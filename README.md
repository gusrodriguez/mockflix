# Mockflix

## What's this?

An emulation of a very well known movies platform (yes, the one with the black background and red fonts :black_large_square::red_square: ), combining Typescript with Redux Thunk and implementing a custom Carousel wiith react-reveal.

## What could it be useful for?
You can reuse the animated carousel component implemented with react-reveal, that will recalculate the amount of items on resize.

### Install dependencies
```
npm install
```

### Run the application
```
npm start
```

### Tech stack
```
- TypeScript
- React
- Redux
- StyledComponents
- React-reveal for animations
- Webpack 4 for building
```

### Coming soon
I will take the carousel component apart to be used as an npm package :drum:
